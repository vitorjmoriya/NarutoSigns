## About

Project for learning CoreML framework by hand gesture recognizer.

> Seals (印, In, English TV: Hand Signs) are used to perform many ninjutsu, genjutsu, and other secret arts other than taijutsu. Invented by Indra Ōtsutsuki[1] in the anime, they are designed to aid people in properly summoning and moulding chakra necessary to perform a technique.[2] There are different sequences of hand seals for every technique, requiring memorisation.

Educational purpose only.
